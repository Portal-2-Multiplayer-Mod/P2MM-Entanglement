## GOALS

- Allow up to 32 players to join a singular game.
- Create a seamless user environment that interacts with its own mini-ified version of the game.
- Have a nice in-game configuration and command system.
- Integrate and patch singleplayer to fit into coop via downloadable packages in the ui. *[Portal 2 Singleplayer, Portal, Portal Stories Mel, Aperture Tag]*
- Use a best guess system to patch workshop maps into a 3+ player format also downloadable from the ui.
